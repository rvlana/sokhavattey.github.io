      <h2>Post 1: My First Week Learning HTML</h2>
      <p><strong>Date:</strong> May 27, 2025</p>
      <p>This week I started learning HTML, the foundation of all websites. I learned how to create headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images. It was exciting to see my first webpage come to life using just simple tags.</p>
      <p>One of the most interesting parts was learning how the browser interprets tags and how structure matters. I also enjoyed playing around with `<div>` and `<span>` elements for organizing my content.</p>
      <p>Next week, Iâ€™ll be diving into CSS to style my site and make it look more appealing!</p>
